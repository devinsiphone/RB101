# rock_paper_scissors_lizard_spock.rb
#
# This game is a variation on the Rock Paper Scissors game that adds two more options - Lizard and 
# Spock. The full explanation and rules are here. There's also a hilarious Big Bang Theory video about
# it here.
#
# The goal of this bonus is to add Lizard and Spock into your code.
#
# Typing the full word "rock" or "lizard" is tiring. Update the program so the user can type "r" for 
# "rock," "p" for "paper," etc. Note that if you do bonus #1, you'll have two words that start with 
# "s." How do you resolve that?
#
# Keep score of the player's and computer's wins. When either the player or computer reaches five wins,
# the match is over, and the winning player becomes the grand winner. Don't add your incrementing logic
# to display_results. Keep your methods simple; they should perform one logical task â€” no more, no
# less.
